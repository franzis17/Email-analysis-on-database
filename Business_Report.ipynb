The oldest email Dasovich sent was in January 8, 2002. The email contains a message that was sent by Allen DeBrum and Dasovich forwarded the email to 5 individuals named Steven Harris, Michelle Lokay, Stephanie Miller, Jane Tholt, and James Steffes.

Alexei added that Mr. Kaminski dissented to the formation of off-balance-sheet partnerships directed by Mr. Fastow, who was the CFO of Enron. Additionally, Brian (Ref-6) states that Enron hid billions of dollars in losses from failed projects and deals, by using complicated off-balance sheet entities and SPEs.

The oldest email Tana sent was in February of 2002, which was after Enron filed for Bankruptcy. The email was sent to 2 individuals named Sara Shackleton and Robert Bruce. The message contained information about whether Tana and the aforementioned 2 individuals should withdraw from trading on the NYMEX.

The earliest email she sent was in May of 1999 and was sent to Patricia Cini. The email contains a message where Sarah asks Patricia if she has sent their form of guarantee, which is a form used for transactions to guarantee an outcome given a condition. The oldest email she sent was in March of 2002 and was sent to Neil Kelly. Based on the contents of the message, Neil and Sara are discussing a global settlement with TXU. As stated on Wikipedia (Ref[8]), TXU is an American retail electricity provider. The message suggests that TXU and Enron had a legal dispute with each other, potentially emerging from Enron’s bankruptcy, and came upon a legal agreement."

        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provides an insight into Enron’s communication patterns and discovers potential topics of interest by conducting three analyses, analysis of email traffic over time, identification of the top email senders and receivers, and analysis of the most frequently used words.\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary of the analysis:\n",
        "* Upon analysing the volume of emails throughout time, it is clear that Enron email communication had more activity in the year of 2001 due to the downfall of the company.\n",
        "* Based on the second analysis of identifying the top senders and receivers of email, most employees have little evidence of their involvement in the fraudulent practices attributed to Enron. \n",
        "* By filtering out meaningless words from the subject attribute of each email, the third analysis has identified that most email subjects had the keyword “Ken Lay”. Using the DB Browser for SQLite program and filtering the message.subject with the word “Ken Lay”, most of the emails are about hundreds of employees demanding Ken Lay to donate fraudulently obtained money to Enron Employee Transition Fund.\n",
        "\n",
        "By performing the three analysis described previously, SQLite databases were clearly understood and extracted the data from the database effectively, used the program “DB Browser for SQLite” to explore the data that is outputted from the analysis, plotted the results of the analysis in the appropriate graph specified in the specification to provide visualisation of the data, and followed the PEP8 programming style naming conventions to apply best practices in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment expects to choose 3 methods of analysis and the 3 analyses provided in the specification only takes an introductory level understanding about the communication patterns of the Enron Email dataset. Based on these expectations, only a limited level of information can be understood about Enron’s communication patterns. For example, Analysis 2 is about finding the top senders and receivers of email, but the output does not provide an in-depth understanding of who the top senders and receivers are and their relation to the problem of Enron’s fraudulent activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis 2 can be improved by gaining more understanding about the relationships between employees based on who communicates with who according to the email dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "A part of the reason why Python Notebooks are usable is its cross-platform compatibility, which allows different users on different machines to access the application independent of which machine they are using. In my experience, I use Google Colab on a Curtin University machine, which runs on Linux and when I’m at home, I run it on a Windows Machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to Data Science projects, Python Notebooks are remarkably useful as they allow users to document the methods and results of their analysis seamlessly. As seen in this Python Notebook, I was able to run programmatic analytical methods and provide my insights about the results of the analysis. Compared to traditionally running Python scripts on a local machine to output a result or a graph, using a Python Notebook makes it less complicated for a client to run a Python script themselves and adds trust since the code can be seen and the output is produced easily.\n"
