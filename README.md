# <b>EnronEmailAnalysis</b>

This project aims to discover potential topics of interest and patterns of communication, in relation to the fraudulent activities that Enron did, by analysing the volume of email over time, Top 20 email senders and email receivers, and analysing email subject keywords.

The purpose of this repo is to monitor changes made in the Python Notebooks and prevent loss of information by reverting back to a previous version of the repo.
